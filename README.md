# coding-project-Budget_app
### The Budget Allocation Application is a project where I delved into the concepts of actions, reducers, and the dispatch function within the context of Redux. These components are fundamental to managing state in a Redux-based application. Throughout the project, I utilized these functionalities to effectively manage the state of the budget application, ensuring smooth and predictable behavior in response to user interactions and other events.
